TODO:
* look for some moose magic to deal with BUILD args
* check out a few other Moose API modules to see if I'm missing anything
  important
* tests (basic, ro and full
  * need to be cognizant of the fact that item creation is rate-limited for
    non-paying users
  * paying users get 1M items/month, so that's a thing
* move wf-test.pl into a separate repo
* think about a persistence layer that syncs w/ wf on init rather than
  grabbing the entire tree
* check the client version, make sure that if it changes, there's a very
  good chance that something will break
* do something better than ghetto parsing of js, or at least make it less
  ghetto
* make the client_timestamp calculation less horribly wrong
