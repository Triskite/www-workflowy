TODO:
rsn
* check the client version, make sure that if it changes, there's a very
  good chance that something will break
* when creating/updating a node, also update $wfl->tree

near future
* look for some moose magic to deal with BUILD args
* check out a few other Moose API modules to see if I'm missing anything
  important
* tests (full rw)
* move wf-test.pl into a separate repo
* implement item deletion
  * also update $wfl->tree when doing this

less near future
* think about a persistence layer that syncs w/ wf on init rather than
  grabbing the entire tree
* do something better than ghetto parsing of js, or at least make it less
  ghetto
* make the client_timestamp calculation less horribly wrong
*
